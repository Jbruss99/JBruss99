### About Me
Hello, My name is Jacob Bruss and I am a senior at Iowa state University studying aerospace engineering. I decided to study aerospace to hopefuuly obtain a job at a general aviation aircraft manefacture such as Cirrus or Cessna (Textron Aviation). Some of my hobbies hunting, golfing and flying. I have my private pilots license and do most of my flying in a 1971 Piper Cherokee 180 we nicknamed "Stubby" for its short wings. Although the majority of my hours are in the Piper I also have a decent amount of time logged in a Cirrus SR22 and a 1947 Cessna 140. I Hope to continue my flight training and get my IFR rating this coming year. I am excited for AerE 361, learning the different programs and technologies that contribute to the aerospace industry.
